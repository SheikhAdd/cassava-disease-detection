## Project Overview

Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a staple food crop in many tropical and subtropical regions, providing essential carbohydrates for millions of people. However, cassava crops are vulnerable to various diseases that can significantly impact yield and quality. Early detection and accurate classification of these diseases are crucial for effective crop management and minimizing losses.

This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to develop an automated system for detecting and classifying cassava plant diseases from leaf images. Utilizing the ResNet50 architecture, both baseline and enhanced models are trained to identify five classes of cassava leaf conditions:

1. **cbb**: Cassava Bacterial Blight
2. **cbsd**: Cassava Brown Streak Disease
3. **cgm**: Cassava Green Mottle
4. **cmd**: Cassava Mosaic Disease
5. **healthy**: Healthy leaves

An interactive web application built with Streamlit allows users to upload leaf images and receive real-time disease classification results.

## Dataset

### Source
The dataset used in this project is based on the [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02900.pdf) research, which provides a comprehensive collection of cassava leaf images categorized into different disease classes.

### Classes and Descriptions

- **cbb (Cassava Bacterial Blight)**: A bacterial infection causing wilting, necrosis, and yellowing of leaves.
- **cbsd (Cassava Brown Streak Disease)**: A viral disease marked by brown streaks on leaves and stems.
- **cgm (Cassava Green Mottle)**: A viral infection leading to mottle patterns and green discoloration on leaves.
- **cmd (Cassava Mosaic Disease)**: A viral disease causing mosaic-like patterns, leaf distortion, and chlorosis.
- **healthy**: Leaves showing no signs of disease.

### Dataset Statistics

| Class    | Number of Images |
|----------|-------------------|
| cbb      | 466               |
| cbsd     | 1,443             |
| cgm      | 773               |
| cmd      | 2,658             |
| healthy  | 316               |
| **Total**| **5,656**         |

## Usage

### Training the Models

The `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook contains all the code required for data preparation, training the baseline and enhanced models, and evaluating their performance.

1. **Open the Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook Cells:**

   - **Data Preparation:** Preprocess and visualize the dataset.
   - **Baseline Model:** Train and evaluate the baseline ResNet50 model.
   - **Enhanced Model:** Train and evaluate the enhanced ResNet50 model with additional layers and fine-tuning.

3. **Model Saving:**

   - The trained models are saved in the `models/` directory as `resnet50_cassava.pth` (baseline) and `enhanced_resnet50_cassava.pth` (enhanced).

### Deploying the Application

The `app.py` script utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive web application for disease detection.

1. **Ensure Models are Trained and Saved:**

   - Confirm that both `resnet50_cassava.pth` and `enhanced_resnet50_cassava.pth` are present in the `models/` directory.

2. **Run the Streamlit App:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the Application:**

   - Open the provided local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) in your web browser.
   - Upload an image of a cassava leaf.
   - View the predicted disease class along with probabilities for each class.
